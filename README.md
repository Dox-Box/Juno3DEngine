# 3D Rendering on Linux, Windows, and macOS
This engine can be used for physics simulations, or for other 3D applications.
<br />Compatibile with Linux, Windows, and macOS <br />

# Getting Started:

<br />
To run the engine, run the Midnight.jar executable file inside the main directory.
<br />
<br />
User-generated runnable scripts for the program are stored inside engine/res/scripts. 
The built-in editor uses this format (.mdnt) to position objects in the world-space, and can also be used to adjust other settings, such as light characteristics.







**Troubleshooting** 

  If you encounter an error when attempting to run, saying that 'error: GLSL 4.0 is not supported.' then check that you have up to date graphics drivers installed. This is a more common issue on Linux based systems.

  If a white box appears on screen, or if you get a black screen on start, this is likely an GLSL (OpenGL shader) crash, and could also be due to bad drivers.
