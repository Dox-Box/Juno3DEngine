# Getting Started:

<br />
To run the engine, run the Midnight.jar executable file inside the main directory.
<br />
<br />
User-generated runnable scripts for the program are stored inside engine/res/scripts. 
The built-in editor uses this format (.orbt) to position objects in the world-space, and can also be used to adjust other settings, such as light characteristics.
