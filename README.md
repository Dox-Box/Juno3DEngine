# Getting Started:
To get the engine up and running on your machine, make sure you have Java 8 or later installed to ensure the best compatibility on your system.






<br />
## Initial troubleshooting:
<br />

If you encounter an error when attempting to run, saying that 'error: GLSL 4.0 is not supported.' then the first thing you should do is check to make sure you have the correct drivers installed. This is a more common issue on Linux based systems, so check if your graphics card manufacturer has a download available for your specific Linux distro.
