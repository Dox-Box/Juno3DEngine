# Getting Started:
To get the engine up and running on your machine, make sure you have Java 8 or later installed to ensure the best compatibility on your system. 
<br />
<br />
To run the engine, run the Midnight.jar executable file inside the main directory.
<br />
<br />
In order to edit the world environment, navigate to /res/script, this where the engine will read in any file with the extension '.mdnt' using the interpreter. Examples are provided on how to use this scripting system, but the engine will only look for files that are inside of this folder, so when creating new scripts, make sure to include them in this folder.

**Troubleshooting** 

  If you encounter an error when attempting to run, saying that 'error: GLSL 4.0 is not supported.' then the first thing you should do      is check to make sure you have the correct drivers installed. This is a more common issue on Linux based systems, so check if your graphics card manufacturer has a download available for your specific Linux distro.
